Quick Show - Movie Ticket Booking App 


Description 


Quick Show is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a seamless platform for users to browse movies, view detailed showtimes, select their preferred seats through an interactive layout, and securely book tickets. The application features integrated user authentication, a robust admin dashboard for show management, and real-time booking updates.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in building end-to-end web applications, integrating third-party services like Clerk for authentication and Stripe for secure payments, and creating a responsive, high-performance user interface.
